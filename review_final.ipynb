[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0) explains hashing & hash tables, then goes into chaining collision resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfect Hash Functions\n",

    "\n",
    "## Collisions\n",
    "When two different keys produce the same index, that's a **collision**. There are a few ways to solve it, but we need to avoid **clustering**, where too many elements are stored too close to each other, because it makes lookup slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open addressing** is when on a collision, you try positions in the probing sequence until either space is found (or the element is found in case of a search) or the structure is full.\n",

    "### Linear Probing\n",
    "Look at the next space until there's an opening. This creates clustering! A slightly better way to do it is to use **quadratic probing**, where you square the index instead of just going to the next one. That creates secondary clustering, but it's not as much of a problem.\n",

Space requirements can be high because it needs to allocate space for pointers.\n",
